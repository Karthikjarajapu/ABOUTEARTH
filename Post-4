<li>Earth is the&nbsp;<strong>third planet from the sun</strong>&nbsp;in our&nbsp;<strong>solar system</strong>. Its name comes from the the old English and Germanic words meaning ‘<strong>the ground</strong>’.</li>

<li>&nbsp;Our amazing planet has been around for quite some time. By researching our planet’s rocks, scientists have calculated the Earth to be around&nbsp;<strong>4.5 billion years old</strong>!</li>

<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Like all the planets,&nbsp;<strong>Earth orbits (travels around) around the sun</strong>. And it does so at some serious speed –– around&nbsp;<strong>30 kilometres per second</strong>, in fact! It takes<strong>&nbsp;365 days</strong>&nbsp;(one year) for the Earth to complete one full orbit.&nbsp;</li>

<li>&nbsp;Have you ever wondered why we have&nbsp;<strong>different seasons</strong>? We’ll tell you –– it’s because&nbsp;<strong>the Earth is tilted 23.4 degrees</strong>&nbsp;<strong>on its ‘axis’,&nbsp;</strong>an imaginary line straight through the middle of the planet form the&nbsp;<strong>North Pole</strong>&nbsp;to the&nbsp;<strong>South Pole</strong>. This means that different parts of the globe are tilted towards the sun at different times of the year (or at different times during its orbit).<br>&nbsp;<br><a href="https://cdn.creatureandcoagency.com/uploads/2018/11/facts-about-the-earth-5.jpg"></a>Not only does&nbsp;<strong>Earth zoom through&nbsp;space</strong>, it also&nbsp;<strong>spins on its axis</strong>. The result? We have&nbsp;<strong>daytime and nighttime</strong>! As the planet rotates, the side facing the sun receives daylight and the the other is in darkness.</li>

<li>&nbsp;People often think of Earth as a gigantic sphere. But, in fact, its shape is more like a&nbsp;<strong>squished ball</strong>&nbsp;that bulges out at the&nbsp;<strong>equator</strong>&nbsp;–– an imaginary line around the middle of the planet, exactly between the&nbsp;<strong>North Pole</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>South Pole</strong>.&nbsp;</li>

<li>This ‘bulge’ is caused by the Earth’s spin and the effect of ‘<strong>gravity</strong>‘. Gravity is an&nbsp;<strong>invisible force</strong>&nbsp;that attracts objects towards each other. It’s this force that pulls things towards the Earth and stops us floating off into space!</li>
