<p>The Earth, which is formed like a sphere or spheroid, is the solar system’s third planet and the only one that can host life. Because of the existence of water, the Earth appears blue when viewed from its outer surface, earning it the nickname “blue planet.” Because there is no life on any of the planets other than Earth, we must be extremely cautious about its preservation. The Earth has a climate that is unique among the planets for its suitability for survival. The climate on Earth is mild, which is good for life. We must be extremely cautious about its preservation because there is no life on any of the planets other than Earth.</p>

<p>Earth has provided us with all of the essential resources we require for living, but we have been exploiting these resources since the beginning since we are greedy humans. It has now become a major concern to our planet. Harmony is the foundational notion that underpins all of the Earth’s biological activities. The biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and the numerous levels and domains of life are in perfect harmony. We may live a healthy existence on Earth because of this coordination and synchronisation. This is very disappointing that nature’s gifts are being mishandled and misused, putting our survival in jeopardy.</p>

<p>The Earth is the third planet from the sun. It is also called the blue planet because it looks blue in colour from the outer surface. The Earth is the only planet that supports life because of the availability of air, water, and gases needed for survival. The climate of the Earth is mild, which is convenient for life. Due to overpopulation, the Earth is in danger and global warming is increasing. In order to save our Earth, we will have to take major steps and be very careful because there is no life possible on other planets.</p>
